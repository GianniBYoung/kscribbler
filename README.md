## Installation

## Upgrade

Same process as installation for now. You should not need to re-add your hardcover token.

I would like to make this over-the-air (OTA) updateable in the future, but the ways I've tested so far have been too hands-on techy for general users.

## Usage

Once installed `nickelmenu` should have a new entry in the right corner of reading view that will trigger a sync when clicked.
To save some battery and resources the sync is only ran against the current/last opened book.

The quotes are uploaded to hardcover.app based on the book's ISBN. See the note below or the troubleshooting section if quotes are not being uploaded.

- If your book doesn't have an ISBN saved to the kobo device's database you can highlight the book's ISBN on its copyright page and `kscribbler` will attempt to parse it and save it to the book's metadata.
  - Can be useful for sideloaded books
  - Currently is uploading the isbn quote to hardcover.app - this is fixable

## Troubleshooting
- Logs are stored in `/mnt/onboard/.adds/kscribbler/kscribbler.log`
- If you are having issues with the quotes not being uploaded, check that hardcover.app has an edition for the ISBN.
- For the savy the sqlite db is located at`/mnt/onboard/.kobo/KoboReader.sqlite`
  - You can modify this database to add an ISBN to a book if you know what you're doing
